Please note that these scripts are made for convenience, where a command will
probably be executed multiple times with the same set of arguments. As such,
they are very sensitive to being moved. Be certain to check and modify the
scripts before executing if the data they rely on has been moved. 

Included scripts:
entityAliasFileFromFreebase.sh - Generate a tab-separated file of entities and
aliases from a Freebase dump. Entities and aliases may appear more than once in
 the file, but each line should only contain one pair. 
See data/examples/exampleAliases.txt.

relationFilesFromFreebase.sh - Generate a tab-separated file of relation 
triplets (entity1, relation, entity2) from a Freebase dump and a list of 
relations. Each line should contain only one relation.
